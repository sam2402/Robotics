The `sketch_mar13a.ino` file contains code to drive a RRR robot to pick up an object placed at an arbitrary position in cartesian space and move it to another arbitrary position in space with linear motion 

.ino files are very similar to C files but they have some features that can be used to interface with an Arduino - an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P
